# Data Science / Capstone

This repository contains a capstone project for the cycle of courses
[Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)
offered on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) by
[Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu).

The purpose of the capstone project is to create a R application for predicting
a next word as a user types text. The algorithm may be used, for example,
in mobile phones to assist typing.
